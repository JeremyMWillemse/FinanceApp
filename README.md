# Finance App
A Mobile application built in React Native using Typescript.


## Software Overview

Very much a work in progress, this app will provide an intuitive workflow for managing finances with greater control than would be provided by a basic monthly budget application.

Users can enter transactions in the form of one-offs, or as predictable recurring cycles. Transactions support any currency, special exceptions, and adjustment rules for non-business days. Recurring transactions can be provided with a start date, and terminal conditions in the form of sum reached (Î£), end date (ðŸ“…), total cycles (n), or indefinite (âˆž).
